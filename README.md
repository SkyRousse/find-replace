# Find Replace

### Learning Ruby

A website where a user enters a string, chooses a word in that string and provides a replacement for that word.

A method that replaces whole words only, making sure all tests are passing.

Method takes into account partial matches. For example "I am walking my cat to the cathedral".find_and_replace("cat", "dog") would return the silly phrase "I am walking my dog to the doghedral."

Make sure to account for odd user inputs like all capitalization, partial capitalization, etc. Include a README for this project and create a Git repository for it.
